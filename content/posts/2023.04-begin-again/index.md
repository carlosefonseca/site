Hello! I'm dipping my toes again on having a "home" on the web.

I've dabbled with blogging and home pages but those were kind of lost or hosted on third parties and mostly abandoned.

I've been playing around with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and it's pretty neat! Started with a [theme](https://hugoloveit.com/) and bended it until it looked sort of like the previous blog, whose style I still like, for some reason.

I'm sure there are bugs here and there, and I'll work on them eventually. 

I'm hoping to post some travel and photography stuff, since photos on the web is a whole can of wormsâ€¦

Baby steps!
